------| INTRODUCTION |------

This module takes selection ntuples and adds several branches containing corrected variables

*MET recoil corrections - does all of the correction and application and stores the corrected MET in new variables
*Lepton scale corrections (as needed) - apply the rochester corretions (electron is applied at selection step)
*calculates the per-event lepton efficiency scale factors and includes it in a new event weight variable
