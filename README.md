Code to get started using Combine in the W/Z cross section measurement

This repository contains examples of how to do the following tasks in the W/Z measurement:

1.fitWe.C - Write the shape templates, in the form of RooPdf's, into a RooWorkspace to be used in Combine.
2.Wenu.txt - An example datacard that uses the shape templates to perform the signal extraction fit for the Wenu channel.
3.wModel.py - An instance of the PhysicsModel class provided by Combine (find this in the python directory) that ties the electroweak background yield to the signal yield for the W boson channels.
