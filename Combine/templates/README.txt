These templates contain the PDFs (for the W channels) and di-lepton mass distributions (for the Z channels) referenced in the datacards and used for the fitting. They were made with the 8 TeV selection samples, and can't be produced using the signal extraction macros in MitEwk13TeV. To produce the templates yourself, log onto a machine running slc5 and configure the 8 TeV MitEwk code (https:://github.com/jaylawhorn/mitewk). Then replace the fitting macros in the SignalExtraction module with the macros in this repository.
